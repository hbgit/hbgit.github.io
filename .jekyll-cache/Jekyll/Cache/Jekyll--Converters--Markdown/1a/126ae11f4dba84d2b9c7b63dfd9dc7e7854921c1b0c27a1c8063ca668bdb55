<p>Iâ€™ve been writing some APPs examples using <strong>Flutter CI/CD</strong> adopting GitHub actions. The steps of the main flow of the project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adopting GitHub as version control from the source code project, thus each commit on branch master is analyzed using flutter analyze</li>
  <li>Running the tests, including widget tests and unit testing</li>
  <li>The results of the tests are then sent to CodeCov (https://codecov.io/) service to analyze the code coverage</li>
  <li>All previously items are done, then the App APK is built in the GitHub repository generating the draft release</li>
  <li>Finally, adopting the GitHub actions, the App is deployed in the GitHub pages using Flutter Web</li>
</ul>
